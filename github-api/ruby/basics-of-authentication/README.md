# basics-of-authentication

This is the sample project built by following the "[Basics of Authentication][basics of auth]"
guide on developer.github.com.

It consists of two different servers: one built correctly, and one built less optimally.

## Install and Run project

To run these projects, make sure you have [Bundler][bundler] installed; then type
`bundle install` on the command line.

For the "less optimal" server, type `ruby server.rb` on the command line.

For the correct server, enter `ruby advanced_server.rb` on the command line.

Both commands will run the server at `localhost:4567`.
