This is the sample project built by following the "[Building Your First GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-your-first-github-app)" Quickstart guide on developer.github.com.

It consists of two different servers: `server.rb` (boilerplate) and `advanced_server.rb` (completed project).

## Install and run

To run the code, make sure you have [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) installed; then enter `bundle install` on the command line.

* For the boilerplate project, enter `ruby server.rb` on the command line.

* For the completed project, enter `ruby advanced_server.rb` on the command line.

Both commands will run the server at `localhost:3000`.
